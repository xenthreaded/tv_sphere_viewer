# tv_sphere_viewer

This project is inspired by the universe of St√©phane Gallay's tabletop roleplaying game "Tigres Volants".

My goal here is to have an interactive map of the known stellar systems called the Sphere. You can get a view of the official map [here(PDF).](https://www.tigres-volants.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Sphere-px.pdf)

If you can read french and want to discover Tigres Volants, check [the official website.](https://www.tigres-volants.org)
